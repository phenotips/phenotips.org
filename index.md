### PhenoTips™ is a software tool for collecting and analyzing phenotypic information for patients with genetic disorders.

* Free and open source
* Web-based application
* Easy to customize

* Standardized phenotyping using the [Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)](http://human-phenotype-ontology.org/)
* Error-tolerant, predictive search of the ontology
* Real-time evaluation of the informational value of the phenotypic description via the [Monarch](http://monarchinitiative.org/) [Phenotype Profile Analysis](http://monarchinitiative.org/analyze/phenotypes/)
* Powerful built-in pedigree editor
* Measurements and growth curves
* Diagnosis assistance based on the entered data

# We are proud to collaborate with

## The Human Phenotype Ontology

PhenoTips enables the collection of phenotype data using the [Human Phenotype
Ontology (HPO)](http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/), a standardized
vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities
encountered in human disease.

Thanks to the detailed terminology and semantic organization of the HPO,
PhenoTips users can specify precise and detailed phenotypic profiles in
a standardized format.

## The Monarch Initiative

The [Monarch Initiative](http://monarchinitiative.org/) builds and maintains
a curated knowledge base that links genotype-phenotype associations across
a large number of species (including humans).

The infrastructure and algorithms developed by the Monarch Initiative provide
the foundation for PhenoTips data analysis features such as diagnosis
suggestions, suggestions of additional phenotypes to investigate, and
phenotypic profile specificity evaluation.
