{{/box}}

The [[standalone package&gt;&gt;PhenoTips.Download]] is a convenient way to try out PhenoTips without a dedicated server, but it is not optimized for production use. The ##war## package, on the other hand, gives complete freedom over the choice of servlet container, database system, performance optimizations, allocated memory, etc. But due to this freedom, the installation process is also harder.

These instructions are specific to a Linux/Tomcat/MySQL deployment. For other environments see [[the generic WAR installation instructions&gt;&gt;Installation]].

== Requirements ==

Java 1.7+, a servlet container, and a relational database. Although it is not mandatory to have external access to the internet, it is recommended that at least during the initial installation and further upgrades to allow access to [[##nexus.cs.toronto.edu##&gt;&gt;http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/]] for PhenoTips to be able to download some of its required files. A SMTP server is also required for sending password reset emails, but otherwise it is not needed, and it can be on a different server if there's already a global mailsending server used in the institution.

The recommended set up consists of:

* **GNU/Linux** as the operating system
* **JDK 1.7+**, either Open JDK or Oracle JDK
* **Apache Tomcat** as the servlet container
* **MySQL with InnoDB** as the database
* **Apache HTTPD** with **##mod_proxy_ajp##** as a reverse proxy
* **Postfix** for sending emails

Everything **should be configured with the UTF-8 encoding**, especially MySQL and Tomcat which have different default encodings.

== Server configuration ==

Follow the operating system specific instructions for installing the Java runtime, Tomcat, MySQL, and the (optional) Apache HTTPD server and mail server.

=== Configuring Tomcat ===

For good performance, PhenoTips requires more memory than Tomcat allocates by default, so **the startup configuration must be updated with custom ##-Xmx## and ##-XX:MaxPermSize## parameters**. On GNU/Linux, this is usually done in ##/etc/tomcat6/tomcat6.conf##, ##/etc/default/tomcat7## or ##/etc/conf.d/tomcat-7##. Find the right file, then add the following line in it:

{{code language="none"}}
JAVA_OPTS="${JAVA_OPTS} -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
{{/code}}

If you have a more powerful server, feel free to increase the ##-Xmx## parameter even further.

Contrary to modern web standards, Tomcat still uses the older ##ISO-8859-1## encoding by default, and this prevents non-ASCII characters from working. To fix this, **the ##server.xml## configuration file must be edited**. This can be usually found in ##/etc/tomcat6/server.xml## or ##/etc/tomcat-7/server.xml##. Inside this file, **search for the two ##&lt;Connector## elements**, one for the ##8080## port and one for the ##8009## port, and **add the following attribute: ##URIEncoding="UTF-8"##**:

{{code language="xml"}}

    &lt;Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-8" /&gt;

...

    &lt;Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" URIEncoding="UTF-8" /&gt;
{{/code}}

If the ##8009## AJP connector isn't enabled, enable it by removing the XML comment markup around it.

**Download the latest [[PhenoTips WAR distribution&gt;&gt;http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/phenotips/phenotips-war/]]**, **unzip it** in a directory named ##phenotips## (or another name of your choice), and **move it to the Tomcat webapps directory**, usually ##/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps##, ##/var/lib/tomcat-7/webapps/## or ##/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/##. If you don't use Tomcat for other applications, you can remove the existing ##ROOT## webapp and use ##ROOT## as the name of the application directory, which would shorten the final URLs where PhenoTips is accessed.

{{warning}}Make sure the user running Tomcat (##tomcat## or ##tomcat7##) has read access on all the application files. You should ##chown -R## the application directory to that user.{{/warning}}

=== Setting up the MySQL database ===

You will have to **create the MySQL database** and **grant access** to a user:

{{code language="sql"}}
create database phenotips default character set utf8 default collate utf8_bin;
grant all privileges on phenotips.* to phenotips@localhost identified by "choose a password";
{{/code}}

Feel free to use another database name and user name. The PhenoTips application will take care of the table creation itself.

You will have to **edit ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml##**, **comment out the default HSQLDB configuration**, **uncomment the MySQL configuration**, and **set the proper database name, username and password**:

{{code language="xml"}}
    &lt;!-- MySQL configuration.
         Uncomment if you want to use MySQL and comment out other database configurations.
    --&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.url"&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost/phenotips&lt;/property&gt; &lt;!-- Replace phenotips with the chosen database name --&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.username"&gt;phenotips_user&lt;/property&gt; &lt;!-- Replace phenotips_user with the chosen username --&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.password"&gt;phenotips_password&lt;/property&gt; &lt;!-- Replace phenotips_password with the chosen password --&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.driver_class"&gt;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="dialect"&gt;org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="dbcp.ps.maxActive"&gt;20&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;mapping resource="xwiki.hbm.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;mapping resource="feeds.hbm.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;mapping resource="activitystream.hbm.xml"/&gt;
    --&gt;
{{/code}}

You must also **edit ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg##** and **add the following line** (replace with the right database name):

{{code language="none"}}
xwiki.db=phenotips
{{/code}}

Make sure the database name created when setting up MySQL database matches the names set in ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg## and ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml##.

=== Configuring PhenoTips ===

PhenoTips needs to have write access to a directory where it can write all its work data and temporary files. ##/var/lib/phenotips/## is a good default choice, but feel free to choose another path. Edit ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/xwiki.properties## and **edit the following line**:

{{code language="none"}}
environment.permanentDirectory=/var/lib/phenotips/
{{/code}}

Make sure **this directory has read-write access for the user running Tomcat**, usually ##tomcat##:

{{code language="bash"}}
mkdir /var/lib/phenotips/
chown tomcat:tomcat /var/lib/phenotips/
{{/code}}

By default attached files are stored in the database, which adds limits to the maximum size of attachments allowed, and slows down performance, but keeps the backup process simpler. If you're going to upload a lot of files, or larger (more than a few megabytes) files, you can enable filesystem storage for attachments. To do this, edit ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg## and add the following lines:

{{code language="none"}}
xwiki.store.attachment.hint=file
xwiki.store.attachment.versioning.hint=file
xwiki.store.attachment.recyclebin.hint=file
{{/code}}

=== Installing the ontology data ===

**Download the [[latest ##solr-configuration## jar&gt;&gt;http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/phenotips/solr-configuration/]]**, and **unzip it in ##/var/lib/phenotips/solr/##** (or if a different permanent directory was chosen in the previous step, in a ##solr## subdirectory in the permanent directory). Make sure **this directory has read-write access for the user running Tomcat**, usually ##tomcat##:

{{code language="bash"}}
chown -R tomcat:tomcat /var/lib/phenotips/solr/
{{/code}}

=== Setting up the mail server (optional) ===

If there is a preferred SMTP mail server installed in the institution, there is an administrative section where PhenoTips can be configured to use it. Simply **go to the global administration** within PhenoTips, **open the //Configuration -&gt; Email// section**, and **fill in the IP or domain name of the server, the port, and optional authentication details**. If TLS encryption is required, then put ##mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true## in the //Additional JavaMail properties// field.

For setting up a new mail server, [[Postfix&gt;&gt;http://www.postfix.org/]] is a good choice, available in most GNU/Linux distributions, and installing it is as easy as ##apt-get install postfix## / ##yum install postfix## / ##emerge postfix##. Make sure it is configured to start automatically on reboot, and start it right away. PhenoTips is already configured to connect to ##localhost## on port ##25## by default, so there's no need to further edit the PhenoTips configuration.

=== Setting up the HTTPD frontend (optional) ===

While PhenoTips can run perfectly well directly from Tomcat on the 8080 port, putting a HTTPD reverse proxy in front makes it easier to configure things such as: complex access rules, HTTPS, better caching of static resources, load balancing, compressed transport, custom error messages when upgrading the PhenoTips backend, etc.

A basic setup would be:

{{code language="apacheconf"}}
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    # Use the right hostname
    ServerName phenotips.host.name.net
    # You can add other aliases
    ServerAlias www.phenotips.host.name.net phenotips phenotips.localdomain

    # Custom logs for PhenoTips
    ErrorLog logs/phenotips.error.log
    CustomLog logs/phenotips.access.log combined
    # For Debian-based systems, use this instead:
    # ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.error.log
    # CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.access.log combined

    # Disables the normal (external) proxy
    ProxyRequests Off

    # Set up access rules
    &lt;Proxy *&gt;
        Order deny,allow
        # You can only allow specific IP ranges instead of all
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Proxy&gt;

    # A custom static HTML page to be displayed when PhenoTips isn't available, instead of the generic Apache 503
    ProxyErrorOverride Off
    ProxyPass /downtime/ !
    # You must provide this document
    ErrorDocument 503 /downtime/error.html

    # Enable the reverse proxy to the servlet container
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    # Certain operations, for example exports of large patient sets, can take more than the default 60 seconds allowed by the proxy; increase this further if required
    ProxyTimeout 300
    # Tomcat has an AJP connector:
    ProxyPass / ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/
    # If PhenoTips is not deployed as the ROOT application (use the correct application path):
    # ProxyPass /phenotips/ ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/phenotips/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
{{/code}}

If you want to use HTTPS:

{{code language="apacheconf"}}
# For port 80, you can either use the configuration above to let the application work both with unencrypted http as well as https,
# or use this VirtualHost configuration to force redirects from http to https:
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    # Use the right hostname
    ServerName phenotips.host.name.net
    # You can add other aliases
    ServerAlias www.phenotips.host.name.net phenotips phenotips.localdomain

    # Enables redirects
    RewriteEngine On
    # If the application is deployed as ROOT:
    RewriteRule ^/(.*)$  https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [QSA,R=301,L]
    # If the application is not deployed as ROOT, but it is the only one on this server, you can redirect automatically to the right path with:
    # RewriteRule ^/$  https://%{HTTP_HOST}/phenotips/ [QSA,R=301,L]
    # If the application is not deployed as ROOT, and it is not the only one on this server, you must only apply the redirect to the right path prefix:
    # RewriteRule ^/(phenotips/.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [QSA,R=301,L]
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

# HTTPS configuration:
&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    # Use the right hostname
    ServerName phenotips.host.name.net
    # You can add other aliases
    ServerAlias www.phenotips.host.name.net phenotips phenotips.localdomain

    # Enables SSL
    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol All -SSLv2

    # Use the right path to the certificate and key
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key

    # Custom logs for PhenoTips
    ErrorLog logs/phenotips.error.log
    CustomLog logs/phenotips.access.log combined
    # For Debian-based systems, use this instead:
    # ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.error.log
    # CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.access.log combined

    # Disables the normal (external) proxy
    ProxyRequests Off

    # Enable SSL support for the reverse proxy
    SSLProxyEngine on

    # Set up access rules
    &lt;Proxy *&gt;
        Order deny,allow
        # You can only allow specific IP ranges instead of all
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Proxy&gt;

    # A custom static HTML page to be displayed when PhenoTips isn't available, instead of the generic Apache 503
    ProxyErrorOverride Off
    ProxyPass /downtime/ !
    # You must provide this document
    ErrorDocument 503 /downtime/error.html

    # Enable the reverse proxy to the servlet container
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    # Certain operations, for example exports of large patient sets, can take more than the default 60 seconds allowed by the proxy; increase this further if required
    ProxyTimeout 300
    # Tomcat has an AJP connector:
    ProxyPass / ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/
    # If PhenoTips is not deployed as the ROOT application (use the correct application path):
    # ProxyPass /phenotips/ ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/phenotips/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
{{/code}}

{{warning}}You are responsible for obtaining a valid certificate for your host.{{/warning}}

Save this in a file called, for example, ##phenotips.conf##, which should be placed in the httpd configuration directory, usually ##/etc/httpd/conf.d##, ##/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/## or ##/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/##. Make sure name-based virtual hosts are enabled in the main httpd configuration file (##/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf## or ##/etc/apache2/httpd.conf##):

{{code language="apacheconf"}}
NameVirtualHost *:80
# For HTTPS, also enable:
NameVirtualHost *:443
{{/code}}

{{info}}The above configuration file assumes that PhenoTips is deployed as the ##ROOT## application, and might not work on all Linux distributions. Check out the Apache HTTPD error logs, usually found in ##/var/log/httpd/error_log## to see any messages about errors in the configuration file. In particular, Debian requires ##${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/## as the prefix for the file location instead of the ##logs/## directory specified in the sample configuration.{{/info}}

== Loading the user interface ==

**Start Tomcat** using the operating system's startup method, usually ##/etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart## or ##/etc/init.d/tomcat-7 restart##. Once Tomcat finishes loading, **open ##http:~/~/&lt;your-server&gt;:8080/phenotips/##** (or ##http:~/~/localhost:8080/## if you renamed the webapp to ##ROOT##, or just ##http:~/~/localhost/## if you enabled the HTTPD frontend), and **the distribution wizard should appear**. **Follow the wizard** to set up the database with the PhenoTips required documents.

== User access ==

You can then log in, with ##**Admin**## as the username and ##**admin**## as the password (**case sensitive**). You should immediately **change this default password**: just click on the ##Administrator## username displayed in the top right menu to access the user profile, and in the //Preferences// pane there should be a //Change password// button.
