{{/box}}

The [[standalone package&gt;&gt;PhenoTips.Download]] is a convenient way to try out PhenoTips without a dedicated server, but it is not optimized for production use. The ##war## package, on the other hand, gives complete freedom over the choice of servlet container, database system, performance optimizations, allocated memory, etc. But due to this freedom, the installation process is also harder.

== Requirements ==

Java 1.7+, a servlet container, and a relational database. Although it is not mandatory to have external access to the internet, it is recommended that at least during the initial installation and further upgrades to allow access to [[##nexus.cs.toronto.edu##&gt;&gt;http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/]] for PhenoTips to be able to download some of its required files. A SMTP server is also required for sending password reset emails, but otherwise it is not needed, and it can be on a different server if there's already a global mailsending server used in the institution.

The recommended set up consists of:

* **GNU/Linux** as the operating system
* **JDK 1.7+**, either Open JDK or Oracle JDK
* **Apache Tomcat** as the servlet container
* **MySQL with InnoDB** as the database
* **Apache HTTPD** with **##mod_proxy_ajp##** as a reverse proxy

More [[detailed instructions for this configuration&gt;&gt;Installation on Tomcat and MySQL]] are available.

Everything **should be configured with the UTF-8 encoding**, especially MySQL and Tomcat which have different default encodings.

== Server configuration ==

Follow the operating system specific instructions for installing the Java runtime, the servlet container, the database engine, and the (optional) frontend server and mail server.

=== Installing the application ===

For good performance, PhenoTips requires more memory than most servlet containers allocate by default, so the startup configuration must be updated with custom ##-Xmx## and ##-XX:MaxPermSize## parameters. At least ##-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m## is recommended, but some enterprise-level containers already consume a lot of resources, so more should be allocated. If you have a more powerful server, feel free to increase the ##-Xmx## parameter even further.

**Download the latest [[PhenoTips WAR distribution&gt;&gt;http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/phenotips/phenotips-war/]]** and **deploy it**. If the container doesn't allow making changes to the configuration files inside the WAR file, then you should unzip it first, make all the changes required in the following steps, re-zip it back into ##phenotips.war##, then deploy the configured application.

{{warning}}Make sure the user running the servlet container has read access on all the application files.{{/warning}}

=== Setting up the database ===

PhenoTips already comes bundled (and configured) with a lightweight, but highly performant database engine — [[HSQLDB&gt;&gt;http://hsqldb.org/]]. If you're happy with this default database, then there's nothing left to do, skip to the next section.

You will have to **create a database** and **grant all access** to a user of your choice. Remember the database name, user name, and password. The PhenoTips application will take care of the table creation itself. Some database systems use //schemas// instead of databases, so create a schema instead.

The default application only includes the database connectors for MySQL and HSQLDB, so for other database systems you have to **include the required connector**. Simply download and place the connector into ##WEB-INF/lib/## in the ##phenotips## application.

You will have to **edit ##WEB-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml##**, **comment out the default HSQLDB configuration**, **uncomment the configuration specific for your database**, and **set the proper database name, username and password**:

{{code language="xml"}}
    &lt;property name="connection.url"&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost/phenotips&lt;/property&gt; &lt;!-- Replace phenotips with the chosen database name, and the database engine type in the URL --&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.username"&gt;phenotips_user&lt;/property&gt; &lt;!-- Replace phenotips_user with the chosen username --&gt;
    &lt;property name="connection.password"&gt;phenotips_password&lt;/property&gt; &lt;!-- Replace phenotips_password with the chosen password --&gt;
{{/code}}

You must also **edit ##WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg##** and **add the following line** (replace with the right database name):

{{code language="none"}}
xwiki.db=phenotips
{{/code}}

Make sure the database name created when setting up MySQL database matches the names set in ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg## and ##webapps/phenotips/WEB-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml##.

=== Configuring PhenoTips ===

PhenoTips needs to have write access to a directory where it can write all its work data and temporary files. ##/var/lib/phenotips/## is a good default choice, but feel free to choose another path. Edit ##WEB-INF/xwiki.properties## and **edit the following line**:

{{code language="none"}}
environment.permanentDirectory=/var/lib/phenotips/
{{/code}}

Make sure **this directory has read-write access for the user running the servlet container**.

By default attached files are stored in the database, which adds limits to the maximum size of attachments allowed, and slows down performance, but keeps the backup process simpler. If you're going to upload a lot of files, or larger (more than a few megabytes) files, you can enable filesystem storage for attachments. To do this, edit ##WEB-INF/xwiki.cfg## and add the following lines:

{{code language="none"}}
xwiki.store.attachment.hint=file
xwiki.store.attachment.versioning.hint=file
xwiki.store.attachment.recyclebin.hint=file
{{/code}}

==== Installing the ontology data ====

**Download the [[latest ##solr-configuration## jar&gt;&gt;http://nexus.cs.toronto.edu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/phenotips/solr-configuration/]]**, and **unzip it in ##/var/lib/phenotips/solr/##** (or if a different permanent directory was chosen in the previous step, in a ##solr## subdirectory in the permanent directory). Make sure **this directory has recursive read-write access for the user running the servlet container**.

=== Setting up the mail server (optional) ===

If there is a preferred SMTP mail server installed in the institution, there is an administrative section where PhenoTips can be configured to use it. Simply **go to the global administration** within PhenoTips, **open the //Configuration -&gt; Email// section**, and **fill in the IP or domain name of the server, the port, and optional authentication details**. If TLS encryption is required, then put ##mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true## in the //Additional JavaMail properties// field.

For setting up a new mail server, [[Postfix&gt;&gt;http://www.postfix.org/]] is a good choice, available in most GNU/Linux distributions, and installing it is as easy as ##apt-get install postfix## / ##yum install postfix## / ##emerge postfix##. Make sure it is configured to start automatically on reboot, and start it right away. PhenoTips is already configured to connect to ##localhost## on port ##25## by default, so there's no need to further edit the PhenoTips configuration.

=== Setting up the HTTPD frontend (optional) ===

While PhenoTips can run perfectly well directly on the 8080 port, putting a HTTPD reverse proxy in front makes it easier to configure things such as: complex access rules, HTTPS, better caching of static resources, load balancing, compressed transport, custom error messages when upgrading the PhenoTips backend, etc.

A basic setup would be:

{{code language="apacheconf"}}
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    # Use the right hostname
    ServerName phenotips.host.name.net
    # You can add other aliases
    ServerAlias www.phenotips.host.name.net phenotips phenotips.localdomain

    # Custom logs for PhenoTips
    ErrorLog logs/phenotips.error.log
    CustomLog logs/phenotips.access.log combined
    # For Debian-based systems, use this instead:
    # ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.error.log
    # CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.access.log combined

    # Disables the normal (external) proxy
    ProxyRequests Off

    # Set up access rules
    &lt;Proxy *&gt;
        Order deny,allow
        # You can only allow specific IP ranges instead of all
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Proxy&gt;

    # A custom static HTML page to be displayed when PhenoTips isn't available, instead of the generic Apache 503
    ProxyErrorOverride Off
    ProxyPass /downtime/ !
    # You must provide this document
    ErrorDocument 503 /downtime/error.html

    # Enable the reverse proxy to the servlet container
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    # Certain operations, for example exports of large patient sets, can take more than the default 60 seconds allowed by the proxy; increase this further if required
    ProxyTimeout 300
    # For containers that have an AJP connector:
    ProxyPass / ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/
    # If PhenoTips is not deployed as the ROOT application (use the correct application path):
    # ProxyPass /phenotips/ ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/phenotips/
    # For containers that only support http (use the correct port):
    # ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
{{/code}}

If you want to use HTTPS:

{{code language="apacheconf"}}
# For port 80, you can either use the configuration above to let the application work both with unencrypted http as well as https,
# or use this VirtualHost configuration to force redirects from http to https:
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    # Use the right hostname
    ServerName phenotips.host.name.net
    # You can add other aliases
    ServerAlias www.phenotips.host.name.net phenotips phenotips.localdomain

    # Enables redirects
    RewriteEngine On
    # If the application is deployed as ROOT:
    RewriteRule ^/(.*)$  https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [QSA,R=301,L]
    # If the application is not deployed as ROOT, but it is the only one on this server, you can redirect automatically to the right path with:
    # RewriteRule ^/$  https://%{HTTP_HOST}/phenotips/ [QSA,R=301,L]
    # If the application is not deployed as ROOT, and it is not the only one on this server, you must only apply the redirect to the right path prefix:
    # RewriteRule ^/(phenotips/.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [QSA,R=301,L]
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

# HTTPS configuration:
&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    # Use the right hostname
    ServerName phenotips.host.name.net
    # You can add other aliases
    ServerAlias www.phenotips.host.name.net phenotips phenotips.localdomain

    # Enables SSL
    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol All -SSLv2

    # Use the right path to the certificate and key
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/server.key

    # Custom logs for PhenoTips
    ErrorLog logs/phenotips.error.log
    CustomLog logs/phenotips.access.log combined
    # For Debian-based systems, use this instead:
    # ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.error.log
    # CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phenotips.access.log combined

    # Disables the normal (external) proxy
    ProxyRequests Off

    # Enable SSL support for the reverse proxy
    SSLProxyEngine on

    # Set up access rules
    &lt;Proxy *&gt;
        Order deny,allow
        # You can only allow specific IP ranges instead of all
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Proxy&gt;

    # A custom static HTML page to be displayed when PhenoTips isn't available, instead of the generic Apache 503
    ProxyErrorOverride Off
    ProxyPass /downtime/ !
    # You must provide this document
    ErrorDocument 503 /downtime/error.html

    # Enable the reverse proxy to the servlet container
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    # Certain operations, for example exports of large patient sets, can take more than the default 60 seconds allowed by the proxy; increase this further if required
    ProxyTimeout 300
    # For containers that have an AJP connector:
    ProxyPass / ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/
    # If PhenoTips is not deployed as the ROOT application (use the correct application path):
    # ProxyPass /phenotips/ ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/phenotips/
    # For containers that only support http (use the correct port):
    # ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8080/
    # RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
{{/code}}

{{warning}}You are responsible for obtaining a valid certificate for your host.{{/warning}}

Save this in a file called, for example, ##phenotips.conf##, which should be placed in the httpd configuration directory, usually ##/etc/httpd/conf.d##, ##/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/## or ##/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/##. Make sure name-based virtual hosts are enabled in the main httpd configuration file (##/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf## or ##/etc/apache2/httpd.conf##):

{{code language="apacheconf"}}
NameVirtualHost *:80
# For HTTPS, also enable:
NameVirtualHost *:443
{{/code}}

{{info}}The above configuration file assumes that PhenoTips is deployed as the ##ROOT## application, and might not work on all Linux distributions. Check out the Apache HTTPD error logs, usually found in ##/var/log/httpd/error_log## to see any messages about errors in the configuration file. In particular, Debian requires ##${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/## as the prefix for the file location instead of the ##logs/## directory specified in the sample configuration.{{/info}}

== Loading the user interface ==

**Start the servlet container** using the operating system's startup method. Once it finishes loading, **open ##http:~/~/&lt;your-server&gt;:8080/phenotips/##** (or ##http:~/~/localhost:8080/## if you renamed the webapp to ##ROOT##, or just ##http:~/~/localhost/## if you enabled the HTTPD frontend), and **the distribution wizard should appear**. **Follow the wizard** to set up the database with the PhenoTips required documents.

== User access ==

You can then log in, with ##**Admin**## as the username and ##**admin**## as the password (**case sensitive**). You should immediately **change this default password**: just click on the ##Administrator## username displayed in the top right menu to access the user profile, and in the //Preferences// pane there should be a //Change password// button.

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Application not deployed ===

Check the Java version actually being used. PhenoTips currently requires at least version 1.7 of the Java Runtime, and will fail to start when running with 1.6 or lower. Although the ##java -version## command might report version 1.7, the servlet container might use a different version, since it has its own way of finding a ##java## command to run. On Linux-like systems, you can run ##ps aux## and look for the java process running the servlet container, which should include a full path to the executable, and execute that full path to see which version it is.

=== Big error stacktrace displayed when loading PhenoTips in a browser ===

The most frequent cause is a wrong connection to the database, either wrong username/password, wrong connection URL, or, if it's not HSQLDB or MySQL, missing database connector.

In general, the top of the stacktrace is not relevant. The proper way to read a stacktrace is to look from the bottom up, looking for the unindented ##Caused by...## lines, starting with the last one. The real cause of the error should be near the end.

=== Distribution wizard not showing up ===

If the application starts correctly, but all you see is a //The requested document could not be found// message, then the distribution wizard, which is supposed to finish installing the required database files, failed to execute. There are two likely causes for this:

* There is a wrong setting in ##&lt;permanentDirectory&gt;/jobs/## or ##&lt;permanentDirectory&gt;/extension/##, try deleting those directories
* The servlet container can't access ##&lt;webappDirectory&gt;/META-INF/maven/org.phenotips/phenotips-war/pom.xml##, check the access rights on that file and on all its parent directories.

=== Broken interface after the distribution wizard finished installing the application ===

Try restarting the servlet container.

=== Distribution wizard showing up after each server restart ===

The most likely cause is that the permanent directory is not configured, or the configured directory isn't writable by the user running the servlet container. Check the value specified in ##WEB-INF/xwiki.properties##, as mentioned in the [[//Configuring PhenoTips// section&gt;&gt;||anchor="HConfiguringPhenoTips"]], and check the access rights on that directory with ##stat /var/lib/phenotips## (use the right directory name). Without a properly configured permanent directory where the application can write its state, a temporary directory will most likely be used, and temporary directories are usually wiped out during restarts.</content>
