  <title>How do I modify a text displayed in the PhenoTips user interface?</title>

  <content>Most of the texts displayed in the PhenoTips user interface are generated using translation keys processed by the [[localization service&gt;&gt;http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Localization+Module]]. This is part of our effort to make PhenoTips available in multiple languages. The translations are defined in ##ApplicationResources[_&lt;language_key&gt;].properties## files bundled with each PhenoTips component.

To override a specific translation, we strongly advise against modifying the ##ApplicationResources.properties## file directly, since this will make upgrades difficult for you. Instead, a practice that allows for more flexibility is to create an [[XWiki Translation document&gt;&gt;http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Localization+Module#HRegisterawikitranslation]] and specify the desired modification in that document instead.

=== Example ===
How to change the label for the patient's date of birth from "Date of birth" to "Birth date":
* To find the translation key, you could search for "Date of birth" in the PhenoTips ##*.properties## files. You will find it in [[##components/patient-data/impl/src/main/resources/ApplicationResources.properties##&gt;&gt;https://github.com/phenotips/phenotips/blob/45d369f26a77ef1b0a27398bd481e345e5b97651/components/patient-data/impl/src/main/resources/ApplicationResources.properties#L45]], and you will see the translation key for the field is ##PhenoTips.PatientClass_date_of_birth##. As a general rule, translation keys for property labels have the format ##&lt;classname&gt;_&lt;propertyname&gt;## (as explained [[in the localization conventions documentation&gt;&gt;http://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/L10N%20Conventions#HTranslatingXClasses]]:
* Create a new XWiki document for translations, e.g. ##PhenoTips/MyTranslationOverrides##
** Open ##https:~//&lt;mydomain&gt;/bin/edit/PhenoTips/MyTranslationOverrides?editor=object##
** Add a ##XWiki.TranslationDocumentClass## object to it
** Set the scope to ##Wiki##
** Save
** Navigate to the document's content editor:  ##https:~//&lt;mydomain&gt;/bin/edit/PhenoTips/MyTranslationOverrides## (just as before, but without the ##?editor=object## query string)
** (((Enter your translation overrides as ##key=value## pairs, one per line. For example:

{{code}}
PhenoTips.PatientClass_date_of_birth=Birth date
{{/code}}
)))
** Save
** Navigate to any patient form to see the results.
