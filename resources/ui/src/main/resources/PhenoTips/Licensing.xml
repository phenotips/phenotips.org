  <content>PhenoTips is available under two licenses:
1. The **Community Edition (CE)** is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 (AGPL), a well known free software/open source license recognized by the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative. You can read the full text at: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html
1. The **Enterprise** version is distributed under a closed-source commercial license from [[Gene42 Inc&gt;&gt;https://gene42.com]].


== Community Edition (CE) ==
The AGPL is a strong copyleft license, which ensures that PhenoTips CE and software built on top of it remain open-source and available to the public. By making PhenoTips CE available under the AGPL:
(% style="list-style-type: disc" %)
* You are free to download, use, modify, and distribute PhenoTips CE according to the terms of the AGPL
* If you modify PhenoTips CE, you must state your changes and disclose the updated source under the AGPL
* If you create a derivative or combined work by integrating PhenoTips CE with other applications, that derivative or combined work must also be made available under the AGPL
(% style="list-style-type: circle" %)
** This applies whether PhenoTips CE is modified or not
** This applies even if the integration only uses the APIs

{{warning}}
For example, the following integrations **are** considered to form a combined work:
* Integrating with an electronic medical/health record system or patient management system (including API integration or UI embedding)
* Integrating with a laboratory information management system (LIMS)
* Integrating with a laboratory test ordering system
* Integrating with a variant/genome analysis platform
{{/warning}}

{{success}}
For example, the following integrations **are not** considered to form a combined work:
* Configuring PhenoTips to authenticate through another system, such as LDAP or SSO
* Configuring PhenoTips to use an SMTP server for email delivery
* Configuring and using PhenoTips CE’s “push” functionality to manually export patient records to another system or receive them from another system in which they were manually exported
{{/success}}


== Enterprise/commercial licensing ==

If you are interested in integrating PhenoTips with closed-source software, such as electronic medical record systems, you can obtain a license from [[Gene42 Inc&gt;&gt;https://gene42.com]]. Gene42 also provides integration and deployment assistance, help-desk support, and custom development services.
